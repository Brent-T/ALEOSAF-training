ALEOS AF training
===============================================================================

Training dedicated to Sierra Wireless [ALEOS Application Framework] (http://www.sierrawireless.com/en/productsandservices/AirLink/AirLinkSoftware/AirLink_Embedded_Software/ALEOS_Application_Framework.aspx).

Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to provide users with some self training material 
about ALEOS AF. It will help users to:

* Setup the whole environment needed to use ALEOS AF.
* Be confortable with the basics of Lua, the programing language used 
  in ALEOS AF.
* Get an overview of the libraries provided by ALEOS AF.
* Be introduced to AirVantage service platform that can help operate 
  ALEOS AF solutions.

Audience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This training targets developers at large. No prior experience with Lua, 
embedded development or Sierra Wireless devices is required. 
However some basic knowledge about programation may be needed.

Labs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The training is devided into "labs" that target one or several aspects 
of ALEOS AF. These labs are built around code samples and associated exercises. 

Each lab includes:

* A README.md file that describes the lab andprovides the instructions 
  for the exercises
* A mock project that need to be imported in the IDE. This project contains 
  Lua files that will be completed during the exercises
* A solution project that can be imported in the IDE in order to be compared
  to the completed mock project.
